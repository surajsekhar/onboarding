### Welcome to the mobile onboarding!

Our the next few weeks you will be going through the android basics. Please folow the topics in order without skipping. If you think you already know somethings, you can move really quickly through them instead of skipping them. We will be using Udacity android courses(https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801) and android developers website(http://developer.android.com/training/index.html) widely for mobile onboarding as they are a very quick and practical way of learning android and provides a good blend between theory and hands on knowledge. It's very important to keep trying everything you read, see and listen for becoming an awesome android 
developer. So let's start!
